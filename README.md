# HTML5 Canvas Sine Wave

A sine wave or sinusoid is a mathematical curve that describes a smooth periodic oscillation. A sine wave is a continuous wave.

y(t) = Asin(2<span>&#928;</span>f + <span>&phi;</span>)

Where:

- **Amplitude(A):**
The amplitude of a sine wave is the maximum distance it ever reaches from zero. Since the sine function varies from +1 to -1, the amplitude is one. 
- **Frequency(f):**
The frequency of a sine wave is the number of complete cycles that happen every second.
- **Wavelength:**
The wavelength is the spatial period of a periodic wave the distance over which the wave's shape repeats.

 wavelength and wavenumber are related to velocity and frequency as: 
 k = 2<span>&#928;</span>/<span>&lambda;</span> = 2<span>&#928;</span>f/v = <span>&omega;</span>/v
